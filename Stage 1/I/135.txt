Vibe awards back despite violence

The US Vibe awards will be held again next year despite a stabbing which happened during the ceremony.

Rapper <b>Young Buck</b> has been charged after allegedly stabbing a man who hit <b>Dr Dre</b> as he was about to receive a lifetime achievement award.

During the ensuing scuffle - which involved many of the 1,000-strong crowd - <b>Mr Johnson</b> was stabbed as he was being dragged away by security staff,
