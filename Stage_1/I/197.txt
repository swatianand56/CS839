Sony horror film The Grudge, starring <b>Michelle Gellar</b>, was the US' second best-selling DVD, with <b>Jennifer Lopez</b> and <b>Richard Gere's</b> romantic comedy Shall We Dance? at number three. <b>Foxx's</b> critically acclaimed performance as Ray has already earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor, as well as a prestigious Golden Globe. Ray director <b>Taylor Hackford</b>, responsible for the classic 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman, has also received an Oscar nomination in the best director category. The film's three other Oscar nominations are for costume, film editing and sound mixing.
